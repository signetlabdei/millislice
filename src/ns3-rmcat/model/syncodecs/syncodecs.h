 * Syncodecs is a family of synthetic codecs typically used to generate synthetic

 * controllers (see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rmcat/">RMCAT IETF group</a>).
 *
 * This header file is the API to interact with the syncodecs family of codecs. The different
 * codecs are declared as classes with inheritance relationships. Class #syncodecs::Codec is the
 * superclass of all codecs.
 *
 * Synthetic codecs range from the simplest (perfect codec #syncodecs::PerfectCodec) to more
 * sophisticated ones (e.g., trace-based codec #syncodecs::TraceBasedCodec). The structure of
 * the syncodecs' API is extensible: other codecs with extra functionality can be added in future
 * versions by subclassing the existing ones.
 *
 * See the documentation of each of the classes in this file for further information on the
 * particular features of the different synthetic codecs.

/**
 * This abstract class is the super class of all synthetic codecs. Congestion control algorithms
 * can use polymorphic pointers/references to this class to operate with any synthetic codec.
 *
 * Synthetic codecs are implemented as STL-like iterators. This is a popular interface among C++
 * programmers and is platform-agnostic. As a result, the syncodecs family can be used both in
 * simulators (ns2, ns3) and in real testbeds.
 *
 * These are the basic steps to use a synthetic codec in your code:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li> Create a codec object from a subclass of #syncodecs::Codec
 *        (e.g., #syncodecs::PerfectCodec). Once created, the codec points to the first frame.</li>
 *   <li> To access the current frame record, dereference the codec object with
 *        operators "*" or "->" (as you would do with any other iterator). The frame record
 *        (#syncodecs::PacketOrFrameRecord) contains a pair (frame contents, time to next frame):
 *        <ul>
 *          <li> The first item is a vector of bytes and represents the payload (encoded frame).
 *               It typically contains garbage (hence the name "synthetic codec"), however the
 *               size of the vector is relevant. For instance, trace-based codecs will output
 *               frames containing zeros, but the frame sizes will reflect the information in the
 *               trace file (see #syncodecs::TraceBasedCodec and its subclasses).
 *               The reason for the pair #syncodecs::PacketOrFrameRecord to contain a vector,
 *               rather than just a scalar holding the size, is that more advanced codecs (or
 *               packetizers) may need to store some information in the payload.</li>
 *          <li> The second item is a real number denoting the number of seconds that the
 *                congestion controller needs to wait before advancing to the next frame.
 *                The main advantage of this interface design is that the syncodecs classes
 *                are totally detached from the threading model used by the congestion
 *                controller's application.</li>
 *        </ul>
 *   <li> To advance to the next frame, use the prepended increment operator ("++"); just as you
 *        would do with an iterator.</li>
 *   <li> The codec has a target bitrate that it will try to output. At any time, you can read
 *        and set the target bitrate using functions #getTargetRate and #setTargetRate .</li>
 *   <li> At any moment, you can cast the codec to a boolean to know if it is in a valid state.
 *        If the codec is in invalid state, it will be false when cast to a boolean. It will be
 *        true if it is in valid state.
 *        Most of the time you do not need worry about this, but some advanced codecs may need
 *        some initialization data, not provided by the constructor, in order to start working
 *        properly. Until this initialization is performed, the codec will be in invalid state.
 *        Another example would be a codec that can provide only a finite number of frames.
 *        When the codec is incremented past the last frame, it becomes invalid.</li>
 * </ol>

/**
 * This codec is an advanced synthetic codec implementation in the syncodecs family.
 * It produces a sequence of frames with realistic sizes. The sequence of frame sizes correspond
 * to real codec output from a video sequence obtained offline.
 *
 * Upon initialization, the codec parses a group of video trace files and loads them in memory.
 * Each trace file contains information on the sequence of frames produced by a real codec.
 * Each line of the file corresponds to a frame record, where several fields can be
 * found (see #FrameDataIterator for further information on the format of the trace file).
 * This codec implementation only uses the "frame size" field (other fields such as frame type
 * or PSNR, included in the trace file, are not used by this codec's algorithm).
 *
 * The codec takes as parameter the path to a directory containing a number of trace files.
 * All trace files in that directory refer to the same raw video sequence, so all files should
 * contain the same number of frame records. Each file contains the traces resulting from encoding
 * the whole raw video sequence with a fixed resolution and a fixed target bitrate. The names of
 * the trace files must follow the following format:
 *
 * <prefix>_<resolution>_<target-bitrate>.txt
 *
 * where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> <i>prefix</i> is an arbitrary string, but the same for all files. </li>
 *   <li> <i>resolution</i> is the fixed output resolution configured to encode the video
 *        sequence offline. It must be one of the following strings:
 *        "90p", "180p", "240p", "360p", "540p", "720p", and "1080p";
 *        which correspond respectively to the following 16:9 pixel resolutions:
 *        160x90, 320x180, 426x240, 640x360, 960x540, 1280x720, and 1920x1080. </li>
 *   <li> <i>target-bitrate</i> is the fixed target bitrate configured in the real video codec
 *        when encoding the video sequence offline. It is an integer denoting kilobits per
 *        second (kbps). The current implementation requires the target bitrate value to be
 *        contained within the range [#TRACE_MIN_BITRATE , #TRACE_MAX_BITRATE ], and
 *        divisible by #TRACE_BITRATE_STEP . </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For example, file <i>myAwesomeVideo_720p_1200.txt</i> contains the video
 * traces (i.e., the frame records) obtained when encoding the original raw video with a pixel
 * resolution of 1280x720 and a fixed target bitrate of 1200 kpbs.
 *
 * @note Ideally, the video trace directory should contain the Cartesian product of a set of
 *       resolutions and a set of target bitrates.
 *
 * Once the codec is set up, and so the video traces have been loaded in memory, the codec
 * transitions to valid state (the codec object will evaluate to true if cast to boolean) and
 * can henceforth be used.
 *
 * This codec's implementation mimics the operation of a real adaptive bitrate codec (ABR).
 * It contains two modes: fixed and variable resolution. For the sake of simplicity in
 * this explanation, let us first focus on the fixed resolution mode. In this mode the codec only
 * uses video traces from a fixed resolution, stored in #m_fixedResIt .
 *
 * The codec looks up all video traces that fulfill the following constraints:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> They have the fixed resolution #m_fixedResIt. </li>
 *   <li> They have a target bitrate that is less than the codec's own target
 *        bitrate (i.e., #m_targetRate , which is set using #setTargetRate ). </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The codec then chooses the video trace with the highest bitrate among those found. It will use
 * the chosen video trace to output its successive frame sizes.
 *
 * When the codec is incremented (operator "++"), an internal index, #m_currentFrameIdx , is
 * incremented to point to the next frame in the video trace currently in use. When the frame
 * info is accessed using operators "*" or "->", the size of the frame reported by the codec
 * matches the size of the frame pointed to by the internal index.
 *
 * When the internal index reaches the last frame in the video trace, it will wrap to the
 * beginning. However, the index will not wrap to the first frame (which is likely to be an
 * I-frame), but to frame number #N_FRAMES_EXCLUDED . This mechanism avoids having an
 * I-frame reported periodically in the synthetic codec's frame sequence. The reason is that
 * the typical behavior of most video-conferencing applications is to have an I-frame as the
 * first frame, and then only encoding other I-frames at the application's demand, when important
 * losses are observed.
 *
 * When the user sets a different target bitrate, the codec will re-run the lookup mechanism
 * explained above, and may end up choosing a different the video trace. However, when the
 * choice of the video trace is changed, the internal index pointing to the current frame in the
 * sequence is not modified. As a result, although the video trace is changed, the current frame
 * still refers to the same frame from the original raw video.
 *
 * Let us now see how the variable resolution mode extends the codec's behavior. When the codec is
 * in variable mode the resolution used in the lookup mechanism is not fixed, but evolves over
 * time. The current resolution is stored in #m_currentResIt . Every time the codec advances to
 * the next frame, an algorithm based of the <i>bits per pixel</i> concept is used.
 * In a nutshell, the codec calculates how many bits of the encoded frame are needed on
 * average for each pixel in the raw frame. If the result is less than a low threshold,
 * #m_lowBppThresh , it means that too few bits are available on average to encode a pixel and the
 * resolution is decreased to the next available (i.e., the next for which the codec has video
 * traces). Likewise, when the bits available on average to encode a pixel are too many
 * (above #m_highBppThresh ) the resolution is increased to the next one containing video traces.
 *
 * The bits per pixel idea works well for resolutions smaller than 540p, for bigger resolutions the
 * codec uses the power of .75 rule, proposed by Ben Waggoner. This rule calculates the bits per
 * pixel of resolution X by taking the bits per pixel results for 540p and applying the following
 * scaling factor: ( # of pixels in a resolution X frame / # of pixels in a 540p frame )^.75
 *

 *       see IETF draft draft-ietf-rmcat-video-traffic-model.
 * @note For further details on the bits per pixel concept and how one can use it in order
 *       to guide the choice of resolution for an encoded frame, see Jan L. Ozer's book
 *       on video compression (ISBN-13:978-0976259503).

/**
 * This codec offers extended functionality with respect to its superclass, #TraceBasedCodec .
 *
 * The #TraceBasedCodec uses the video trace data as is. It does not scale or interpolate it.
 * This class implements a scaling and interpolation algorithm that provides smoother results
 * in terms of frame sizes when the target bitrate undergoes small variations. Note that, when
 * the target bitrate variations are small, the #TraceBasedCodec tends to output <i>the same</i>
 * sequence of frame sizes.
 *
 * This is a short description of the scaling and interpolation algorithm. When the codec advances
 * to the next frame, the bitrate immediately below (same as #TraceBasedCodec ) and the bitrate
 * immediately above the current target bitrate are looked up in the video traces of the
 * current resolution. There are three cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The current target bitrate is neither less than the minimum bitrate nor greater
 *        than the maximum bitrate of all video traces of the current resolution. In this case,
 *        the resulting frame size is calculated by linear interpolation of the current frame
 *        sizes for the below and above video traces. </li>
 *   <li> The current target bitrate is less than the minimum bitrate of all video traces of the
 *        current resolution. In this case the resulting frame size is calculated by
 *        scaling the frame size for the below video trace, with respect to the current
 *        target bitrate. </li>
 *   <li> The current target bitrate is greater than the maximum bitrate of all video traces of

/**
 * This codec is part of the group of packetizers. It is aware of the maximum payload that it
 * should output.
 *
 * The #ShapedPacketizer is not a full-fledged codec, but a wrapper of other codecs. Its
 * constructor takes another codec as parameter: the inner codec. The idea behind the shaped
 * packetizer is that it extracts frames from the inner codec, and then splits them and
 * delivers those fragments as its own packets/frames. Obviously, the best inner codec candidates
 * are those that are not subclasses of #Packetizer .
 *
 * Another aspect of the shaped packetizer is that it performs a mild shaping of the
 * packets/frames. Rather than delivering all fragments of an inner frame as soon as the
 * inner frame is available, it shapes the delivery of the fragments: it spreads their delivery
 * throughout the "seconds to next frame" value of the inner codec.
 *
 * For example, consider an inner codec that has just advanced to its next frame (i.e.,
 * the shaped packetizer's implementation has just called the "++" operator in the inner codec).
 * The size of the new inner frame is 3500 bytes, and the inner "seconds to next frame" value
 * is 40ms. The user has configured the shaped packetizer with 1000 bytes as maximum payload size
 * and 0 as per-packet overhead. In this situation, the shaped packetizer will output the next
 * 4 packets/frames at 10-ms-long intervals, the first 3 of those 4 packets/frames will be
 * 1000 bytes long and the 4th will be 500 bytes long. Finally, when the shaped packetizer advances
 * beyond the 4th packet, it will advance the inner codec and process the new inner frame.
 *
 * The codec supports a per-packet overhead to be configured. The meaning of this value is how
 * many bytes are going to added to every packet/frame when it is sent over the network. The codec
 * uses this information to throttle the inner codec's target bitrate. The goal is that
 * the target bitrate set on the shaped packetizer is as close as possible to the actual bitrate
 * sent over the network. This is typically useful when one is using a rather simple
 * codec (e.g. #SimpleFpsBasedCodec) to test a congestion control algorithm and does not want
 * the network per-packet overhead (e.g. IP+UDP+RTP headers) to affect the result plots.
 *
 * If you do not need to care about your network's per-packet overhead, you can just set its
 * value to 0.

/**
 * This synthetic codec mimics the operation of a real codec by implementing a statistical
 * model. This model has two phases: the steady phase and the transient phase.
 *
 * The codec is in the steady phase as long as the changes in the target rate are not
 * substantial. A change is substantial when the ratio new rate/old rate is greater
 * than  #m_bigChangeRatio (this threshold is configurable in the class's constructor).
 * While in steady state, the codec creates a sequence of frames, whose size is chosen
 * to fit the target rate given that the frames are sent at  #m_fps frames per second.
 *
 * When there is a substantial change in the target rate, the codec enters transient phase.
 * The transient phase has fixed duration #m_transientLength expressed in frames. In the
 * transient phase, the first frame is an I-frame, and is modeled as a frame whose size
 * is #m_iFrameSize bytes. This I-frame size tends to be much bigger than the reference frame
 * size at the current target rate. This value has been observed to depend on the codec type,
 * resolution and/or video sequence, but not on the current target bitrate. The size of the
 * remaining frames in the transient phase are made smaller to compensate for the I-frame's
 * size, so that, at the end of the transient period the average bitrate still fits the
 * target rate. In any case, these remaining frames in the transient phase will never be smaller
 * than 0.2 times the size of a steady frame, so if the I-frame is very big, or the transient
 * period is very short, the average bitrate of the transient period might overshoot the
 * target rate.
 *
 * Whether in steady state or transient state, the last step before delivering the frame
 * is to modify its size to simulate noise. This size is modified by applying a
 * function to the frame size that (slightly) modifies it. The function to apply is stored
 * as a callback in #m_addFrSizeNoise , which can be set in via the constructor of the class
 * to any callback function that the user may provide. If the user does not provide a function
 * the default callback, #addLaplaceSize , is used. The default callback modifies the size
 * of each frame by enlarging/shrinking according to a laplacian random distribution.
 * As mentioned above, to model the noise in frame size the user can provide a different
 * implementation as a callback in the constructor.
 *
 * There is another callback provided to add noise to the (otherwise constant) frame interval
 * configured. The default callback also implements a laplacian random distribution.
 *
 * Both default noise models have been chosen according to observations made during our study
 * of the behavior of Firefox's h264 codec implementation.
 *
 * There is a limit to how much the current target rate can be changed in one shot: the
 * ratio between the old and the new value for the target rate cannot be bigger
 * than #m_maxUpdateRatio . There is one exception: it the ratio old/new value for target
 * rate is bigger than #m_bigChangeRatio (substantial change), the limit does not apply,
 * the target rate changes to new value, and (as explained above) the codec enters in
 * transient phase.
 *
 * Finally, when the user updates the target rate, the codec will refuse any further update
 * for the next #m_updateInterval seconds.
 *
 * @note For further details on this algorithm and the default noise functions, please see
 *       IETF draft draft-ietf-rmcat-video-traffic-model.

 *
 * When in the steady phase, the codec behaves according to its trace based parent class,
 * providing frame sizes according to the traces loaded in memory when the codec's C++
 * object was instantiated. In the transient phase, the codec sends a big (I-)frame followed

 * transient phase are modified by the noise function #m_addFrSizeNoise ; just like the
 * statistics codec.

 * @file
 *
 * Here are some examples on how to use the most relevant codecs of the syncodecs family.
 *
 * EXAMPLE 1.
 *
 * In the first example we replay the behavior of various codecs in slow motion. We
 * slow down 100 times to appreciate the effect of changing the target bitrate.
 *
 * Sample code:
 * @code
 * #include "syncodecs.h"
 * #include <memory>
 * #include <cassert>
 * #include <iostream>
 * #include <iomanip>
 * #include <unistd.h>
 *
 * #define MAX_PKT_SIZE 1000 // bytes
 *
 * void setRate(syncodecs::Codec& c, unsigned int rate) {
 *     std::cout << "    Setting target rate to ~" << rate << " Mbps" << std::endl;
 *     float result = c.setTargetRate(rate * 1e6f);
 *     assert(result == rate * 1e6f);
 * }
 *
 * void playCodec(syncodecs::Codec& myCodec, unsigned int framesPerRate, int nframes, unsigned int slowDown) {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < nframes; ++i) {
 *         if (i % framesPerRate == 0) {
 *             setRate(myCodec, i / framesPerRate + 1);
 *         }
 *         ++myCodec;
 *         std::cout << "      Time for frame/packet #" << i << ", size: "
 *                   << myCodec->first.size() << std::endl;
 *         std::cout << "        waiting " << std::setprecision(2) << myCodec->second * 1000.
 *                   << " ms..." << std::endl;
 *         usleep(myCodec->second * 1e6 * slowDown);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 *     std::cout << "Playing the behavior of various codecs in slow motion..." << std::endl;
 *     std::cout << std::fixed;
 *
 *     const unsigned int slow1 = 100;
 *     std::cout << "  Perfect codec. "
 *               << slow1 << "x slower:" << std::endl;
 *     std::auto_ptr<syncodecs::Codec> codec1(new syncodecs::PerfectCodec(MAX_PKT_SIZE));
 *     playCodec(*codec1, 10, 200, slow1);

 *
 * EXAMPLE 2.
 *
 * In the second example, we demonstrate how one can simulate three different codecs, running
 * concurrently, with only one simulation thread. In this example we have chosen to use
 * a more advanced codec setup, in order to demonstrate the usage of the trace-based, the
 * statistics, and the hybrid codecs.
